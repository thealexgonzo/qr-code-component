### What I learned

This was a great simple challenge to get back into using HTML and CSS as I've been focusing on JavaScript for the past few weeks. I don't think I was able to get the shadow effect quite right, on my machine it didn't seem like the colors provided by the design matched exactly the shadow effect so I had to create my own.

It was still great to practice and remind myself how to use the `box-shadow` effect:

```css
.card {
  box-shadow: 0rem 2rem 8rem var(--shadow_gray);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm satisfied with how this design turned out, in the next projects I would like to practice CSS Grid and SASS a lot more.
